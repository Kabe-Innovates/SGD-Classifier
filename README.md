# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
```
1.Initialize Parameters: Set initial weights (theta) to zero.
2.Compute Predictions: Calculate predictions using the sigmoid function on the weighted inputs.
3.Calculate Cost: Compute the cost using the cross-entropy loss function.
4.Update Weights: Adjust weights by subtracting the gradient of the cost with respect to each weight.
5.Repeat: Repeat steps 2–4 for a set number of iterations or until convergence is achieved.
```

# Load the Iris dataset

# Create a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
df['target'] = iris.target
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2,
random_state=42)
# Create an SGD classifier with default parameters
sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3)
# Train the classifier on the training data
sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = sgd_clf.predict(X_test)
# Evaluate the classifier's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")
# Calculate the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(cm)
